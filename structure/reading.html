        <div class="reading-whole-page">
        <div class="reading-main">

            <div class="book">
                <img class="book-cover" src="Piranesi.jpg">
                    <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">Piranesi</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0px;">I love this book and I cant recommend the audiobook enough! Plz read... <br><br>
                        
                        "Piranesi’s house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.
                    <br><br>There is one other person in the house—a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge..."</p>

            <div class="book">
                <img class="book-cover" src="CARMILLA-2e-web-medium.jpg">
                <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">Carmilla</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0px;">This book is basically lesbian Dracula, and it predates Dracula by over two decades!! If you love vampire novels or 19th century literature, you will (hopefully) love Carmilla >:)<br><br> 
                        
                        "In an isolated castle deep in the Austrian forest, Laura leads a solitary life with only her ailing father for company. Until one moonlit night, a horse-drawn carriage crashes into view, carrying an unexpected guest – the beautiful Carmilla. So begins a feverish friendship between Laura and her mysterious, entrancing companion."

            <div class="book">
                <img class="book-cover" src="Angels.jpg">
                <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">Angels in America</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0px;">Okay so this is actually a play, but I think it's a great read as well as a great watch. There's also a lovely HBO adaptation that does it a lot of justice!

                    "The play is a complex, often metaphorical, and at times symbolic examination of AIDS and homosexuality in the United States in the 1980s. Certain major and minor characters are supernatural beings (angels) or deceased persons (ghosts). The play contains multiple roles for several actors. Initially and primarily focusing on one gay and one straight couple in Manhattan, the plot has several additional storylines, some of which intersect occasionally."
