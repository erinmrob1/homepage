                    <blockquote>I think there’s so much power in being able to create websites from scratch. Websites and especially their making can feel very elusive or out of reach for most people. I think there’s a lot of beauty in the ability to make something for the web that feels unique or doesn’t even resemble, “actual websites” as they’re called in My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? </blockquote>
                    <p>The concept of “actual” websites is something I want to get away from a bit in this class. Now I’m not saying none of what I design will resemble these “actual” websites, but I believe there’s so much flexibility/possibility in web design.</p>

                <p>I’d like to explore what else it can be. What comes to mind when thinking about a website as a container is an essay/interview by Elan Ullendorf. <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-130084325?r=2068yr&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" target="_blank">The two-part substack post</a> is about websites as love letters and in it he interviews internet artist Chia Amisola.
                <br><br>
                That said, I’d still like to use my knowledge to expand the limited HTML and CSS I’m using on my personal website and to be able to make it look just as I imagine it (or at least as close as I can get).</p>

                    <blockquote>Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere — manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created.

                    <blockquote>“How did we get here? Well… as the computer was commoditized, users became the primary source of value. Commercial incentives drove corporations to establish proprietary ecosystems to capture market share, setting off fierce competition for “frictionless” experiences that deliberately concealed the logic inside. And with computers designed to be ever-more complex, while interfaces made ever-simpler, the gap between user and machine only grew wider.”</blockquote>

                    <p>proprietary ecosystems/vendor lock-in: we depend on products that are not widely understood and whose technology is not accessible without obtaining them from a third party who stands to gain (usually) money.<br><br>

                    I feel that these dependencies become even harder to escape the more the tech becomes intertwined with capital and work. this idea also reminded me of a couple of quotes from Elan Ullendorff’s  <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/escapethealgorithm/p/the-case-for-an-anti-productive-ai?r=2068yr&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" target="_blank"> The Case for an Anti-productive AI: </a> </p>

                <blockquote>“But god-adjacent control over tools has always led to a different, more nefarious loss of control. Our history is riddled with examples of tools that were supposed to save us time—cars, dishwashers, workplace communication tools—that instead propelled us towards more responsibility and less leisure time.”</blockquote>

               <p>The idea of a computer has changed drastically from what its original function/purpose was. This reflection makes me wonder how else we might contextualize or use computers (ie. as a city) if they weren’t now so commonly associated with productivity/work or buying things.</p>

                        <li>There are barriers between what we have the power to change and influence. app reviews vs city council or protest</li>
                        <li>There’s an exterior kind of customization and personalization w/ computers or apps, but the real software/hardware changes are out of our control similar to how infrastructural/policy/etc. changes may be out of reach for citizens in a city though we have control over a small percent of the whole (our property).</li>
