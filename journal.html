        I think there’s so much power in being able to create websites from scratch. Websites and especially their making can feel very elusive or out of reach for most people. I think there’s a lot of beauty in the ability to make something for the web that feels unique or doesn’t even resemble, “actual websites” as they’re called in My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? 
        <br><br>
        The concept of “actual” websites is something I want to get away from a bit in this class. Now I’m not saying none of what I design will resemble these “actual” websites, but I believe there’s so much flexibility/possibility in web design. I’d like to explore what else it can be. What comes to mind when thinking about a website as a container is an essay/interview by Elan Ullendorf. The two-part substack post (https://substack.com/home/post/p-130084325) is about websites as love letters and in it he interviews internet artist Chia Amisola.
        <br><br>
        That said, I’d still like to use my knowledge to expand the limited HTML and CSS I’m using on my personal website and to be able to make it look just as I imagine it (or at least as close as I can get).

        <p>
        web as something that “ought” to be changes/updated with the times, otherwise it's obsolete or dated
        <br><br>
        same logic is not applied to other forms of art/historical documentation... text compared it to to illuminated manuscripts, which feel clearly indicative of a time and are never expected to appeal to our current tastes
        <br><br>
        "Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere — manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to change.""
